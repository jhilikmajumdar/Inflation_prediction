Inflation Trends and Economic Insights (1960-2022)


#### **1. Data Preprocessing:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values. This could be by imputation or deletion depending on the nature and amount of missing data.
- **Data Transformation**: Convert the data into a format suitable for time series analysis, possibly setting the year as an index.

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- **Global Overview**: Plot a global average inflation rate over the years to see the general trend.
- **Country Specific Trends**: Plot the inflation trends of individual countries. 

---

#### **3. Comparative Analysis:**
- **Highest and Lowest**: Identify the years when the highest and lowest inflation rates occurred for each country.
- **Decade-wise Analysis**: Calculate average inflation for each decade and see which decade had the highest and lowest inflation for each country.

#### **4. Predictive Modeling:**
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Using models like ARIMA or Prophet, forecast the inflation rates for the next 5 years for each country.
- **Factors Influencing Inflation**: If you have additional datasets (like GDP, unemployment rate, etc.), you can build regression models to see how these factors influence inflation

#### **5. Clustering and Segmentation:**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Cluster countries based on their inflation patterns over the years. This will help identify countries with similar economic behaviors.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use techniques like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM to identify years where inflation rates were anomalous.

---

#### **6. Insights and Recommendations:**
- **Economic Behaviors**: Based on clusters, can we identify economic behaviors or policies that are beneficial or harmful?
- **Future Preparations**: Based on the forecast, how should countries prepare for future inflation trends?
