#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- **Global Overview**: Plot a global average inflation rate over the years to see the general trend.
- **Country Specific Trends**: Plot the inflation trends of individual countries. You can create interactive plots using libraries like `Plotly` for better visualization.
- **Grouped Analysis**: Group countries by continents or economic status (developed, developing, underdeveloped) and analyze the inflation trends within these groups.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Understand if and how the inflation rates of different countries are correlated.

#### **3. Comparative Analysis:**
- **Highest and Lowest**: Identify the years when the highest and lowest inflation rates occurred for each country.
- **Decade-wise Analysis**: Calculate average inflation for each decade and see which decade had the highest and lowest inflation for each country.
- **Economic Events**: Correlate significant inflation spikes or drops with major global economic events (e.g., oil crises, global recessions, financial crises).
